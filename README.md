# Analysis of Mercury Levels in Albertan Fish

## Introduction

This repository contains an analysis of mercury levels in various fish species across Alberta. The goal is to identify regions and species exhibiting elevated mercury concentrations in various fish species, which could inform policy decisions, health advisories, and scientific research.

### Data

The data folder contains the files used in the analysis, sourced from the Government of Albertaâ€™s open data portal, as well as the cleaned dataset, created in the Cleaning notebook.

* The dataset (`hg-in-fish_ah-1997-2020_20230921.xlsx`)
* The data dictionary (`hg-in-fish-column-dictionary.xlsx`)
* The cleaned dataset (`df_clean.csv`)

### Notebooks

* `Cleaning Steps - Hg in Albertan Fish.ipynb`: This notebook includes the process of cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.

* `Analysis - Hg in Albertan Fish.ipynb`: This notebook contains the analysis of the cleaned data, focusing on identifying patterns in mercury distribution and potential health defects in fish.

### Visualizations
