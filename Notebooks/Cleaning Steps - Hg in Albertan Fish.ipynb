This notebook is dedicated to the data cleaning and preparation process for an in-depth analysis of mercury levels in various fish species across Alberta. The goal is to prepare a dataset that accurately reflects the mercury concentrations in these species, which can then be used for detailed analysis.\n","\n","### Data Source\n","[Data was sourced](https://open.alberta.ca/opendata/chemical-monitoring-in-local-foods-mercury-in-fish) from the Government of Albertaâ€™s open data portal, encompassing measurements from 1997 to 2020. The dataset includes standardized mercury testing results from multiple fish species across Alberta's seven distinct regions.\n","\n","### Data Processing and Cleaning\n","In this phase, the initial dataset contained 6008 records and 25 columns. To refine the dataset for analysis, irrelevant columns were removed and missing values were addressed. This resulted in a cleaned dataset of 3781 records across 13 columns, spanning from 1997 to 2020.\n","\n","### Limitations\n","This process focuses solely on the data available up to 2020. It is important to note that some rows with missing data or 'Unknown' values were excluded (except in the case of the 'Sex' of the species) to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the measurements.\n","\n","### Citations and References\n","Relevant literature and supplementary data sources are cited where applicable to provide context and support for the data cleaning process."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Cleaning Process"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df = pd.read_excel(\"../data/hg-in-fish_ah-1997-2020_20230921.xlsx\", engine=\"openpyxl\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["      Program_ID      Sample_ID Collection Date Date_flag Waterbody Name  \\\n","0  13-AK-LKWH-01  14-AK-LKWH-01      2013-09-18         0     Amisk Lake   \n","1  13-AK-LKWH-02  14-AK-LKWH-02      2013-09-19         0     Amisk Lake   \n","2  10-AK-NRPK-01     FHg11-0101      2010-09-16         0     Amisk Lake   \n","3  10-AK-NRPK-02     FHg11-0108      2010-09-16         0     Amisk Lake   \n","4  10-AK-NRPK-03     FHg11-0112      2010-09-16         0     Amisk Lake   \n","\n","  Waterbody Type   Latitude   Longitude  Land Use Region FWMIS ID  ...  \\\n","0           Lake  54.597508 -112.636283  Upper Athabasca     3916  ...   \n","1           Lake  54.597508 -112.636283  Upper Athabasca     3916  ...   \n","2           Lake  54.597508 -112.636283  Upper Athabasca     3916  ...   \n","3           Lake  54.597508 -112.636283  Upper Athabasca     3916  ...   \n","4           Lake  54.597508 -112.636283  Upper Athabasca     3916  ...   \n","\n","  Fork LengthMeasurement  Total Length (mm) Total LengthMeasurement  \\\n","0                   Field               560                   Field   \n","1                   Field               570                   Field   \n","2                   Field               484                   Field   \n","3                   Field               528                   Field   \n","4                   Field               605                   Field   \n","\n","  LengthEstimateFactor Weight (g) WeightMeasurement Maturity Age (years)  \\\n","0                  NaN       1990             Field   Mature          23   \n","1                  NaN       2000             Field   Mature          16   \n","2                  NaN        510             Field   Mature           4   \n","3                  NaN        800             Field   Mature           3   \n","4                  NaN        950             Field   Mature           5   \n","\n","  Aging Structure Hg (mg/kg)  \n","0        Otolith       0.083  \n","1        Otolith       0.072  \n","2       Cleithrum      0.456  \n","3       Cleithrum      0.497  \n","4       Cleithrum      0.651  \n","\n","[5 rows x 25 columns]\n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 6008 entries, 0 to 6007\n","Data columns (total 25 columns):\n"," #
